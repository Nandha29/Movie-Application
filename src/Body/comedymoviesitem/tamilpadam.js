    <p>Tamil Padam, parody mockumentary comedy film. This movie took a comical dig at some of the clichés that a typical Tamil cinema hero would follow.
    some of them: ‘Thou shall worship the Mother over all Gods. Thou shall not let thy sister’s feet touch the ground. Thou shall fall in love and marry a rich girl irrespective of how poor you are. Thou shall sing and dance with her in exotic foreign locations. Thou shall fight against corrupt politicians and gangsters even if they are your girlfriend’s daddy.</p>
