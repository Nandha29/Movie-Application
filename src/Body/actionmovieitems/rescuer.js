    <p>The story begins 11-years-ago when this obsessed man begins making a documentary film on abandoned animals, and he shoots what he expects to be "bookends" for this film. The dogs he meets that fateful day take him on a chase that ends ten days short of two years later, with resounding success. The very process of filming both tragedy and comedy, unexpectedly forces the rescuer to discover the underlying motives of why he changed the course of his life, and why he feels compelled to dedicate the rest of that life to the plight of suffering animals, even at the expense of his own dreams.</p>
